# World Generation

Implements a 2D array data structure to house a tile-based, interactive world exploration engine. Uses text-based tiles along with pseudo-randomized walls, hallways, and rooms to trap and kill players. Also includes additional features like charater swap and HUD tile hovering avaiable in the main menu.
